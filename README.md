Crossmint Code Challenge Phase 1 &amp; 2

### Phase 1 
In this first part of the challenge the first approach used was to create a class Cross to generate a cross with an specific length for a given map shape. However, as the code for the second phase is also functional for this phase, the Cross class is commented in the bottom of the code and the code of phase 2 is used.  The code is commented just if you want to use that approach. 


### Phase 2
For phase 2, a class Map was created in order to copy the goal map into our map. The methods used to create the copy are createCopyofGoalMap and createCopyofGoalMap_v2, which are pretty similar. (One runs the whole map checking each cell what value it is, and the second one runs the whole map for each element).
